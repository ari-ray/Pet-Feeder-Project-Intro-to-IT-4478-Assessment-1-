## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete submission for Assignment 1. The project involves applying the five steps of the integrated problem-solving process to design the logic for a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder for an animal shelter.

The proposed system is designed to:
- Dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times.
- Monitor if food has been consumed.
- Alert staff about system issues, such as the food not being dispensed or an empty food container.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to the steps of the problem-solving process for the assignment.

*   **`/Step1_Analysis`**: Contains the initial problem analysis, including the problem statement, assumptions, limitations, input and output definitions, and a system block diagram.
*   **`/Step2_DataDescription`**: Includes the data table outlining all system variables, their types, description along with sample values and operational constraints.
*   **`/Step3_Flowchart`**: Contains the system's algorithm as a flowchart. This folder includes both the exported image (`.jpg`) and the source `.drawio` file.
*   **`/Step4_Word_Code_Implementation`**: Presents the solution's algorithm implemented in Pseudocode, that is, plain English as a sequence of tasks.
*   **`/Step5_Testing_and_Refinement`**: Details the test scenarios used to asseess the system, to compare expected and actual outputs, a discussion of the results, and proposed refinements for the system.
*   **`/Part3_AI_Reflection`**: Contains the reflection on using an AI agent (Microsoft Copilot) to assist with logic refinement, documentation, and exploring implementation details.

## Technology and Tools Used

*   **GitHub:** Used for version control and project documentation.
*   **Draw.io:** The tool used to create the system logic flowchart in Part 1: Step 1 and Step 3.
*   **Markdown:** Used for writing and formatting `README.md` files.
*   **Microsoft Copilot:** Used as an AI assistant to refine the project's logic and documentation as required in Part 3.
